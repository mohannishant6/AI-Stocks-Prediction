The folder consists of the algorithms used by the AI agents. There are mainly 4 algorithms -

##### Investor 1: Profit Maximization
Greedy approach looking for stocks with highest difference in predicted stock values

##### Investor 2: Risk Minimization
Selecting stocks on the basis of highest confidence predictions

##### Investor 3: Dual-Objective Optimization
Selecting stocks using a scalarized function of Risk and Reward metrics for pareto optimal points. Using combination ranks for prioritization of stocks.

##### Investor 4: Hold-Out with Risk Minimization
Selecting stocks using highest confidence levels along with withdrawing earning when the earning crosses the baseline i.e. initial balance. This algorithm shows how we get a more resilient and consitently performing system by risking less.
