Stock markets are highly volatile. While the GDP growth of many countries remain positive, they have substantial fluctuations in their stock markets. There is no single method to accurately predict a stock’s value because the value of a stock is a function of numerous variables. While there have been many attempts [3,4,5,6,7] at prediction using sentiment analysis based on news reports, annual reports and time series data based on previous trends etc., there is no single go-to solution. Stock prediction is a hard problem because one needs to know the relationship between all financial assets as well as the link between assets and the economy. 
The Automated Regression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model has been the leading approach to make short term predictions in financial domain. ARIMA is an amalgam of Auto-Regression and Moving Average (ARMA) which makes it a statistical approach for forecasting. The functioning of ARIMA is built on the design that consecutive values of a time series are greatly dependent, successive value can be expressed as linear combination of previous values and errors:
Y_t=\emptyset_0+\emptyset_1Y_{t-1}+\emptyset_2Y_{t-2}+...+\emptyset_pY_{t-p}+\varepsilon_t\ -\ \theta_1\varepsilon_{t-1}-\theta_2\varepsilon_{t-2}-...-\theta_q\varepsilon_{t-q}	(1)
Where Y_t is the actual value and \varepsilon_t is the random error at t, \emptyset_i and \theta_j are the coefficients, p and q are integers that are often referred to as autoregressive and moving average, respectively. 
ARIMA predicts the value based on its three principal parameters (p,d,q), where p is the  lag observations included in the model, d is differencing degree and q is the moving average window. In order to get optimum values of p & q, two different correlation plots are drawn- auto-correlation function (ACF) and Partial Auto Correlation function (PACF). The ACF provides moving average order, it shows how effectively current value from the series relates with its previous values. The PACF discards irrelevant features since it fetches correlation between residuals and next value of the series. 
In practical applications, historical data of stocks forms a non-stationary time series because stock prices are prone to fluctuation. Forecasting such non-stationary time series without transforming into stationary time series can be relatively cumbersome as stationary time series has constant statistical properties such as average and variance. ARIMA works well with stationary time series. However, this pre-processing part can take a lot of time to determine values of p,q and transform the data in adequate format. Fortunately, Auto-ARIMA obviates laborious part of the method by taking care of these three steps.
Even when the stock value can be predicted with moderate success, we still need to build up a portfolio of investments so that maximum possible financial gains are achieved. Building a robust model to accurately predict a stock’s price is only half the work done. The next stage is building a portfolio of stocks to invest in, so that the financial gains can be maximized. Portfolio theory was laid initially by Markowitz [1], wherein the author proposed mean-variance model. 
The model is given as:
Minimize	\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}{X_iX_j\sigma_{ij}}		(2)
Subject to	\sum_{i=1}^{N}{X_i\mu_i}>\beta			(3)
0≤X_j≤1				(4)
\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_i=1,\ i=1,2,3...,N	(5)
Where Xi are portfolio weights or investment proportions, \mu_iare the expected return of stock i.  Equation 2 is an objective function to minimize risk of the portfolio represented by variance of a portfolio. Equation 2 guarantees desired return b of a portfolio. Equation 3 conveys that the model is for purchase trades only. Equation 4 guarantees total resource allocation.
However, there are several limitations of this model. One is that proportion of stocks to be bought is concentrated towards few stocks only. Another limitation is due to the tendency of model to avoid extreme variances, which leads to restrain from low and high value returns at the same time.
Owing to these limitations, there have been several researches on other methods of portfolio selection [2,,,]. These are broadly categorized into single-objective and multi-objective models. Single-objective models can either minimize the risk or maximize the profit, while multi-objective models can take care of both, risk and profit, at the same time [8]. Some of the approaches have been explained in the next section.
The main motivation behind this article is to provide a starting point for the beginners in stock market investment. As such, we explain the concepts and algorithms used in detail. In the present work, we demonstrate a stock portfolio management system wherein we first identify a set of stocks to invest in, and then to optimize the amount to be invested in each of them for maximum financial gains. We first employ an Auto-ARIMA model on a set of 400 stocks to predict the best performing ones. Next, we build up a portfolio of stocks to invest in. We demonstrate and compare four algorithms that select which stocks make up to the portfolio each day as well as their proportion in the total amount invested:
	Reward Maximization
	Risk Minimization
	Reward Maximization and Risk Minimization
	Hold-out with Risk Minimization
The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses several previous research applying ARIMA models, and search algorithms employed for portfolio selection. Section 3 defines the problem and discusses the search algorithms employed. We discuss the results in section 4 and present our conclusions in section 5.
