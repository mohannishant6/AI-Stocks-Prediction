1.	Time series forecasting, ARIMA- Mondal et. al. [4] realised that only predicting the value may not be sufficient, rather the accuracy of prediction which depends on the model as well as parameters used in the model are also important in establishing the utility of a model. They made separate categories of stocks based on the sector of the company to measure the model accuracy on. Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) is a generally acceptable measure for the goodness of fit of a statistical measure; lower the AIC, better the model. The authors use AIC with correction for finite sample sizes in their research. The authors prove empirically that the model’s accuracy differs in different sectors. As such, different models are needed for different sectors.
2.	Arima and neural net- Researchers have used many techniques to predict time series data with varying accuracy. Most notable of these are ARIMA and Artificial Neural Networks. Adebiyi et. al. [3] compared the performance of ARIMA and ANN architectures in a stock value prediction task. They concluded that the performance of both models was good and forecasting error for both the models was quite low. ANNs outperformed ARIMA by a small degree. Also, the forecast of ARIMA was directional while that of ANNs was towards value forecasting. Despite better performance of ANNs, the authors did spend more time towards fine-tuning the model and parameters of ANNs as compared to ARIMA. Therefore, in a real-life application, the choice of model would be a function of cost and resources since the difference in reward, which is stock value prediction accuracy in this application, is small.

5.	Multi- Armañanzas et. al. [2] apply three different algorithms to the multiobjective problem- greedy approach, simulated annealing and ant colony optimization. In greedy approach, the neighbors of an initial random solution are visited and selected if one of them is better than the previous one. However, the disadvantage of this approach is that the solution may fetch a locally optimal solution. Simulated annealing mimics the mechanical process of annealing a solid in order to reduce the tensions or energy within the solid. Therefore, just as a particle within a solid being annealed tries to find a position of minimum energy when we vary the temperature of solid, this algorithm tries to find an optimal neighboring position that minimizes the objective function of this approach and reaches an optimum point by varying a search control parameter. The ant colony optimization algorithm is wherein many agents act as ants and build up a solution or a part of a solution, while taking into consideration the current global state of the task at the same time. The authors use this method and employ three agents, one to maximize the profit, second to minimize the risk and the third balancing the trade-off between them, to identify the best strategy for portfolio selection.
