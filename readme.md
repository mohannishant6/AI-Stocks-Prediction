>Investing in stocks is a great way to set aside money while one is busy with life and make that money work so that one can reap benefits out of that investment. The question is how to choose which stocks to invest in? With the advancements in machine learning we can now make informed prediction from historical data about the future state of a stock. We present an intelligent system that strategizes investments over a group of stocks to get the maximum benefit. We compare four algorithms in this paper with different investment strategies that we implement and test in a virtual trading environment.
